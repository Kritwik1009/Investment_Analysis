# Investment_Analysis
The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in

For our analysis, we will consider a country to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country
These conditions will give us sufficient information for your initial analysis.

We have taken real investment data from crunchbase.com, so the insights we get may be incredibly useful.
